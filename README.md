# Flight Testing Documents

This repository contains document templates for many flight testing cases, such as checklisting and flight logs.  They are not intended to contain a complete set of points for all flight testing, but instead to guide your own set of documents.  

# Checklists and Planning
- `Flight Checklists`
  - Example flight checklists for before the day, beginning of day, and before each flight
- `Model Pre-Flight Test Checklist`
  - An example checklist to give students to follow when setting up an aircraft for flight.  It covers many of the aircraft setup and radio configuration students typically find challenging.  It also includes what they need to do to plan a flight test.
- `Student Flight Test Planning Checklist`
  - A checklist / questionaire for students to use that helps guide them through the goals of their flight test, and how to communicate with the pilot the plans, abort criteria, and other elements of the proposed test.
  
# Logging
- `Flight Logs`
  - An example sheet containing important information for logging flights.
- `Maintainence Logs`
  - Examples of sheets to fill out when doing any vehicle maintainence / upgrades (both software and hardware).
- `On-Battery Charge Tracker`
  - An example label to attach to a battery to easily track the number of cycles a battery has been through.
